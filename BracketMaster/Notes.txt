General notes.



Texas Match Card System

Be able to create a set of matches given a list of brackets. The matches need to be spread over the brackets
such that a competitor has at least 1 match rest. Different size brackets may have different ways of allocatating the
mathces. A round robin is different than a double-elimination bracket.

Double Elimination
    Go through all the winners first. By the time the 1st place is decided, all other initial positions on
    the loser bracket side will be known.

Should the program take into account the necessity of giving a rest or should that be done manually?
    When creating a match, could insure that neither player was in the previous match.
    Need to figure out what to do in that situation.
